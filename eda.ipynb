    "## Problem Statement and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The main domain that I will be exploring is League of Legends Esports, which is a competitive online game that is played by teams worldwide for money and prizes. Over the past decade, League of Legends has exploded in popularity, with their international tournament, Worlds, [grossing nearly 7 million concurrent viewers in 2024](https://escharts.com/news/2024-league-legends-worlds-record). League of Legends is distinct from other cognitive sports like poker or chess in that it features a “drafting phase” prior to the start of games, which involves players picking which champions they will play in the game itself. Deciding which champions to pick is an incredibly complex process, as there are over 170 to choose from, and all have complex interactions that may make them more or less favorable as the draft progresses. Gaining a better understanding of draft is relevant to not only the teams themselves, but also sports betters and analysts: [In 2023, esports betting was valued at $2.5 billion](https://www.skyquestt.com/report/esports-betting-market), and [the prize pools for Worlds 2025 alone will be $5 million](https://esportsinsider.com/2025/03/league-of-legends-lol-world-championship-2025-prize-pool).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, the main question that I am interested in is, “Can machine learning models accurately predict the outcomes of professional League of Legends games using historical game data and pre-game statistics?”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Game outcome in this instance could be measured a number of different ways: Primarily, my starting point will be whether the game is won or lost, which seems to be the most straightforward to predict. Other potential outputs to explore could be a composite index of team or individual player performance, including objectives taken, damage dealt, gold accumulated, and kills/deaths/assists.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main pre-game factors explored will be the teams, the draft, and the date, although these alone could be augmented into a number of other statistics, such as the team's head to head win rate or the draft's individual champion's win rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used is the Leaguepedia API, which is a third party API maintained to support Leaguepedia, a wiki for League of Legends Esports. Although it is not an official source, the API is well-maintained with very little missing attributes, especially for the professional tiers of competition where I will be pulling most of my data. The main challenge in working with this dataset is not the lack of data, but rather accessing it - The data is stored in a highly normalized format across nearly 100 different tables, requiring several joins to get the desired information. The full list is available [here](https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Special:CargoTables), but the most relevant tables are [ScoreBoardGames](https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Special:CargoTables/ScoreboardGames), which contains stats for each game, [MatchScheduleGame](https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Special:CargoTables/MatchScheduleGame), which has less granular per-game data, [MatchSchedule](https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Special:CargoTables/MatchSchedule), which represents a match (a set of 1-5 games), and [Tournaments](https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Special:CargoTables/Tournaments), which represent the context in which matches are played. In addition, the SQL client available for accessing it doesn't allow subqueries, imposes a limit of 500 rows returned per request, and has a rate limit. Because of this, querying data can be a long process, and cached when possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Joining/Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in data processing was fetching historical match data. For the purpose of match prediction, since League of Legends is such a dynamic game, for the purposes of predicting future match outcomes, only the data from the last few years is relevant. In addition, to limit the influence of quality of play on prediction quality, I chose to limit the data to only professional games in the major regions, or international tournaments. The match ids that meet this criteria can be fetched as follows:\n"
